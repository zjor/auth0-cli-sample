# Auth0 CLI Sample

A demo on how to authenticate a CLI application and access an API endpoint with a token received from Auth0.

## Run cli

`python -m cli.auth`

## TODO

- secured backed API example => return proper response if token is expired
- store token & use refresh token if expired
- introduce cli command to invoke all functions
